# dispatcher-project

For our final project in the Data Science Bootcamp at [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/data-science-course/part-time) we predicted the pick-up time of parcels using real world data from a dispatcher company. A big part was handling large tables, combining them and engineering features. On top we built an ML and a DL model of which we used the DL model finally because it performed a lot better. We built a solid pipeline with data loading und preprocessing steps running in python scripts. The model was deployed in the cloud and we also built a small web interface to demo the model. We were able to improve the baseline accuracy score of 0.24 to a score of 0.54 with the ML model and even 0.86 with the DL model. The Timeframe of the project was 10 full days with 3 collaborators. For version control and collaboration we used Github and for the dashboard trello.
